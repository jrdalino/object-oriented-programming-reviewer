## Behavioral Patterns
### Memento
- Without violating encapsulation, capture and externali ze an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this st ate later.
### State
- Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its cl ass.
### Iterator
- Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
### Strategy
- Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
### Template Method
- Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm 's structure.
### Command
- Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
### Observer
- Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
### Mediator
- Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes l oose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
### Chain of Responsibility
- Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
### Visitor
- Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visi tor lets you define a new operation without changing the clas sesof the elements on which it operates.
### Interpreter
- Given a language, define a represention for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.

## Structural Patterns
### Composite
- Compose obje cts into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
### Adapter
- Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets cl asse swork together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
### Decorator
- Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamica lly. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
### Facade
- Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interfa ce that makes the subsystem easier to use.
### Flyweight
- Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
### Bridge
- Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two canvary independently.
### Proxy
- Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Creational Patterns
### Abstract Factory
- Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete cl asses
### Builder
- Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations
### Factory
- Define an interface for creating an obje ct,but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
### Prototype
- Specify the kinds of obj ectsto crea te using a prototypical instance, and create new objec ts by copying this prototype.
### Singleton
- Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
